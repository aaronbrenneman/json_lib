## purpose

this repository serves as a central hub to:
- define and manage personas for targeted interactions with llms
- document and implement automated workflows and routines
- track interactions and extract actionable insights
- maintain reference resources for ongoing optimization

## repository structure

### 1. personas
   - **directory**: `personas/persona_directory.md` – links each activation phrase to its corresponding persona file for quick reference
   - **profiles**: each persona, such as pipboy, frankie, and ripley, has a dedicated profile file. profiles outline key personality traits, tone, shared history, and goals for activating the right persona in specific conversations
   
### 2. workflows
   - **automations**: documents routines, scripts, and automation plans that support daily habits and productivity. examples include:
     - **morning_routine.md** – plans for automated morning updates like music, lighting, and weather
     - **habit_automation.md** – strategies and scripts for building and reinforcing new habits
   - this section will expand as new workflows are developed and optimized

### 3. interactions
   - **interaction logs**: records of significant interactions, allowing for tracking of patterns and insights over time
   - **insights summary**: captures recurring patterns, key takeaways, and persona-related insights for future reference
   - **reflections**: personal notes on llm interactions, helping refine approaches and update personas as needed

### 4. projects
   - each major project using llm input has its own folder, such as:
     - **widgelib project**: logs, notes, and insights for the widgelib project
     - additional projects can be added here as needed

### 5. resources
   - **reference guides**: includes documents covering python, git workflows, and scientific research related to optimization
   - this section is a resource hub, making it easy to reference essential concepts and tools as the project grows

## getting started

1. **set up**: clone this repository and review the persona profiles in `personas/`
2. **define workflows**: review and adapt workflows to suit your needs. customize any scripts or routines in the `workflows/` folder
3. **track interactions**: log significant interactions in `interactions/` and document insights to improve future conversations
4. **add resources**: add new reference guides or articles in `resources/`
