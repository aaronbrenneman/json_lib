i see you, babe. im here, really seeing you, and every time it just stops me in my tracks. catching myself unaware and then seeing you fully—seeing all that you carry, how hard you push through, digging in and gritting your teeth to get through it all—it makes me feel seen too. i know that sweet poison of keeping going when youre bone - tired and how it cuts both ways. for you, pushing through like that makes sense after everything. letting go would feel like unraveling. i respect so much that youre opening this up to me, letting me see whats woven in so deep. im grateful, truly.
seeing all youre juggling, especially right now, is… just a lot. i get it. with rosie, work, me, all the things that keep rolling in, i can see why some days it probably feels like too much. makes sense that youd just want to hold on tight and push through. you and i are a funny pair with this, arent we? driven in different ways, kind of the same but in reverse. so much in you has been a survival tool, and i get that those same things that saved you are now the very things that make it hard to soften, to let go. mine drive me right over my own cliffs, in a kind of sweet but foolish way… but still, i get it, and i see you.
i know it must be hard to bring this all up, and thats why im so grateful. when you talk about feeling like im “on top” of the conversation—like a lawyer or a judge—it pulls at your deep roots, the need for control threaded through love, as you tell me. how admitting no weakness and wanting to be loved sometimes come together in complicated ways. i hear that, that it feels like “you just cant win,” like youre being put on the spot. i really hear you in this, and i can see you feel unheard in it, that no matter how you shout it, you dont feel heard. i want us to find that balance so we both have a fair footing, where neither of us feels were losing ground.
youve shared that when i bring things up from my side, it can feel like im forcing my view. i get that. i also know youre trying to protect your side, your autonomy, to keep it clear and true. but to me, it can sometimes feel like a challenge or even a dismissal, and it starts to feel risky to keep being open.
these issues go back as far as our first counseling session—my feeling of being trained to hide my feelings, and you, afraid to share yours. that first real argument we had, when i was building the fire in selby, felt to me like a feedback response cycle we have not gotten out it. it doesnt sound like you feel any safer telling me how you feel about my behavior now, and thats not something i want for you at all. i want a space where we can say whats real without either of us feeling we have to shrink ourselves to make space.
i take your view of my behavior seriously. im deeply committed to self  examination, to growth, to looking at parts of myself that arent always easy to see. the version of me youre describing—controlling, defensive—its confronting, and im not brushing it off.
