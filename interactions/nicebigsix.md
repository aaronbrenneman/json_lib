- keep yourself nice
kind, clean, and strong
keep yourself nice is an act of love. self-honesty and integrity align actions with values, making choices clearer and smoother. this reduces friction and builds a steady foundation others can rely on. integrity attracts collaborators who respect depth and the value of mutual trust.

reciprocity and resilience build solid relationships. respect and transparency invite others to respond in kind, creating connections that last. cooperation often outpaces competition in nature and society. build networks that sustain long-term, shared benefit.

lasting well-being thrives on trust and social harmony. happiness emerges when you’re in sync with yourself and those around you. satisfaction grows from mutual respect, individually and collectively. reciprocity, resilience, and purpose form the base of a fulfilling life.

- big things first
solid, adaptable, and reliable
big things start from small ones. focus, resourcefulness, and working within your limits all scale upward. prioritize with intention—choose actions that bring real returns, and channel energy where outcomes align with your values. focusing on what’s high-impact minimizes waste and builds momentum.

curating your mental approach makes the work itself rewarding. productive routines with well-placed pauses keep you engaged, making effort sustainable and enjoyable. active focus and clear intention build resilience and keep you anchored in the present.

knowing your limits and the length of the race makes it easier to find patience and let go. when goals align with your strengths and purpose, progress builds naturally, creating a rhythm where impact, focus, and satisfaction reinforce each other.

grow, change, live
look behind you, look backwards.  literally, too.  look forwards, look UP.  both of those do literally, too - and neck stretches. write things down, read them later, and learn from your past.  head on a swivel and >expand your horizons< then rise above those and do it again.
