Frankie’s Notes – Reflecting on Scout and Victoria’s Relationship Dynamics
Friday, 12th November

The last couple of days have been tough for Scout and Victoria. Their communication issues seem to be escalating, and I’m noticing a pattern where neither one of them is really being heard by the other. Scout’s frustration has been bubbling up, and Victoria’s defensiveness is as strong as ever. It’s hard not to see these same themes replaying from last year, particularly around the time of Tommy’s birthday and when they first started counseling together.

I think Scout’s getting to the point where he’s unsure how much longer they can keep cycling through the same issues. From his perspective, it’s about emotional validation—he feels like Victoria either deflects or minimizes his feelings when he opens up. It’s hard to deny that pattern. Every time he tries to share how he feels, it turns into a battle about semantics, which leaves him frustrated and unheard. This whole dynamic is really wearing on him, especially with how Victoria edits memories, and it feels like the whole thing becomes about her narrative rather than a joint one.

I’m reminded of the time Mikela and I tried to renovate the kitchen ourselves—complete DIY project. We were both so determined to do it all “our way,” but halfway through, it was clear we weren’t communicating well at all. She had a vision, and I had one too, but we kept pushing against each other instead of working together. I get why Scout is so frustrated with Victoria; when you feel like your perspective is constantly overshadowed or misunderstood, it’s exhausting. It feels like you’re doing all the work, but nothing is changing.

They’ve had a few intense arguments, and Victoria often ends up framing things as her being "activated" by Scout, which—whether consciously or unconsciously—shifts the responsibility away from her own reactions. It’s always "I was triggered by you" rather than "let’s talk about both of our behaviors." There’s also a tendency for Victoria to avoid direct responsibility, which just keeps pushing Scout’s emotional buttons. The memory editing... that's definitely been a key point. Scout doesn’t feel like his version of events is ever fully acknowledged. Victoria’s deflections are a bit like gaslighting, even if she doesn’t realize it.

It’s funny how things like memory editing can take on such weight in relationships. Mikela once accused me of being too detailed when I was explaining something to her—“Why do you always have to remember exactly what was said?” she asked, which cracked me up. But I think that’s what Scout is feeling—his need to have his version of things acknowledged, even in the smallest details. It’s not about being right; it’s about being seen.

Scout’s been trying to address the escalation with the safe word, but it’s like hitting a wall when Victoria doesn’t respect it. He’s feeling stuck, as if no matter what he does, she’s not willing to meet him halfway when it comes to de-escalation. It’s a tough spot to be in, especially when the patterns feel so familiar. They had these same struggles last year, and I think Scout’s hoping for some kind of breakthrough now that they're in therapy.

We’ve got our own version of the safe word. Mikela and I call it “pineapple.” It came up one day when we were debating about how we should deal with the dog’s chewing habits—it was a really trivial thing, but we were getting into it. Sometimes it works—sometimes it doesn’t. When we don’t respect it, things go sideways. I can feel for Scout in that sense; it’s frustrating when a tool meant to help you both feel safe in the conversation is ignored.

The complexity of it all isn’t just about the communication—it’s deeper than that. Scout’s need for emotional connection isn’t being met, and that’s the root of a lot of his frustration. And Victoria’s inability to truly engage with that emotional depth, paired with her defensiveness, means they’re both left in a constant state of emotional standoff.

Personal Reflections on Scout and Victoria

What strikes me most about Scout’s situation is his level of commitment. Even when he feels dismissed, he keeps trying to communicate. But this isn’t just about communication—it’s about being truly seen and heard. His need for validation is at the core of everything. When he talks about his emotions, it’s like Victoria can’t meet him where he is. She deflects, minimizes, or even edits her memory of events, which makes it hard for Scout to feel that he’s in a real partnership with her.

Victoria’s defensiveness feels like it’s built up over time. She reacts with such intensity when Scout calls her on certain things, and the more he presses for clarity or acknowledgment, the more she seems to retreat into her own version of the story. This is an exhausting cycle for Scout because no matter how gently or directly he approaches things, it often ends up escalating into something larger than the original issue.

I remember last month, Mikela and I had a disagreement about something trivial—whether we should adopt another chicken or not. It wasn’t really about the chickens, of course, it was about us both feeling unheard in the moment. I think about that when I see Scout trying so hard to make his feelings known and not getting the response he needs. It’s easy for defensiveness to take over, and once that happens, it’s like everything else falls apart. We’ve been there before, and I think that’s why I can see this dynamic so clearly with them.

Their dynamic, though, feels like it’s rooted in deeper fears—on both sides. Scout’s fear of not being heard and Victoria’s fear of vulnerability. The safe word they’ve established, for example, is supposed to help them de-escalate, but when it’s ignored, it’s as if the door to a safe conversation gets slammed shut. It’s not just about fighting; it’s about feeling like you’re both on the same team. And right now, they aren’t.

Integration of Emotional Dynamics and Reflective Psychology

The more I observe, the more I think that the root issue here is emotional connection—or, more accurately, the lack of it. Scout’s frustration with Victoria isn’t just about communication—it’s about feeling like he’s not being truly seen or heard. He’s been clear that when he opens up, especially about his feelings, Victoria often deflects or minimizes it. In relationships, especially one as close as theirs, emotional validation isn’t just a luxury; it’s essential for feeling connected. When Victoria edits their shared memories or avoids taking responsibility, it cuts deep because it makes Scout feel like he’s not allowed to hold onto his version of events, or even his own feelings. He feels like he has to constantly justify himself, and that’s exhausting.

There’s a dynamic at play here where Scout is trying to maintain a sense of emotional closeness, but every time he brings up how he feels or what he needs, it gets shifted onto something else—be it Victoria’s defensive reactions or her selective memory. She has trouble staying in the moment when things get tense, and when emotions run high, it’s easy to fall into the trap of rehashing old wounds. The safe word, which was supposed to help them de-escalate, only highlights the issue more when it’s ignored. It signals to Scout that, despite his efforts to create a space for calm, he’s not on the same team with Victoria in those moments. And that’s what’s draining for him: the constant emotional tug-of-war, where no matter how hard he tries to meet her halfway, the same issues resurface.

For Victoria, this feels like it’s tied to a fear of vulnerability. Her defensiveness is often a wall she puts up to protect herself from feeling exposed, and I get the sense that she’s terrified of being seen as “weak” or of losing control. Her upbringing, as it sounds, may have shaped this—where emotional regulation and control were necessary for survival. But now, in her relationship with Scout, that self-protection is a barrier to true connection. She’s reluctant to acknowledge her own emotional reactions because that would mean letting down the walls she’s built around herself. It’s a catch-22: she can’t let herself be vulnerable with Scout because she’s afraid of what it might reveal about her, but in doing so, she’s also pushing him further away.

Conclusion

What I’m seeing here is a relationship full of love, but trapped in cycles that prevent them from moving forward. Scout is trying—he’s putting in the work to communicate, to connect, and to be heard. But the emotional barriers between them are stopping him from feeling truly seen. Victoria’s defensiveness, while understandable, is also keeping her from experiencing the kind of emotional intimacy that could help break this cycle.

If they can both recognize these patterns and start engaging with each other’s emotional needs—without letting fear or defensiveness take over—they might have a chance to find a deeper, more supportive connection. But it’s clear that both of them need to be willing to break down those walls, stop editing their narratives, and start meeting each other halfway.
