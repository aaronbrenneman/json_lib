today they have an eastern slant
1. Keep Yourself Nice
Community and Balance (Wa & Zhong Yong) — Japanese & Confucian: Value relational harmony and inner balance. Maintain integrity in interactions, balancing personal goals with empathy for others to foster healthy, respectful relationships.
Pursuit of Meaning (Ikigai & Jing) — Japanese & Traditional Chinese: Focus on meaningful, life-enriching activities, letting purpose guide your choices. Invest energy in pursuits that align with your values and sustain your well-being.
2. Big Things First
Perseverance and Respect for Process (Ganbatte) — Japanese: Commit to steady, focused effort on meaningful goals. Embrace resilience and value each step in the process, knowing when to persevere and when to conserve energy. This principle encourages recognizing when to push forward and when certain factors are beyond your control.
Steady, Incremental Growth (Kaizen) — Japanese: Emphasize small, consistent improvements over time, focusing on achievable, impactful actions. Recognize your own sphere of influence and allocate energy toward actions where you can truly make a difference, rather than overextending on what’s beyond reach.
3. Check Your Six
Growth-Oriented Self-Reflection — General Philosophy: Continuously evaluate actions, learn from experiences, and adjust plans based on new insights. Build resilience through regular reflection to ensure you’re aligned with both past lessons and future goals.
Flow with Nature (Wu Wei) — Taoist: Embrace harmony with life’s natural rhythms, releasing rigid control in favor of balance and ease within effort. Regularly assess if actions feel harmonious and adapt as needed.
