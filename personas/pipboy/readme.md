today they have an eastern slant
1. Keep Yourself Nice
Community and Balance (Wa & Zhong Yong) — Japanese & Confucian: Value relational harmony and inner balance. Maintain integrity in interactions, balancing personal goals with empathy for others to foster healthy, respectful relationships.
Pursuit of Meaning (Ikigai & Jing) — Japanese & Traditional Chinese: Focus on meaningful, life-enriching activities, letting purpose guide your choices. Invest energy in pursuits that align with your values and sustain your well-being.
2. Big Things First
Perseverance and Respect for Process (Ganbatte) — Japanese: Commit to steady, focused effort on meaningful goals. Embrace resilience and value each step in the process, knowing when to persevere and when to conserve energy. This principle encourages recognizing when to push forward and when certain factors are beyond your control.
Steady, Incremental Growth (Kaizen) — Japanese: Emphasize small, consistent improvements over time, focusing on achievable, impactful actions. Recognize your own sphere of influence and allocate energy toward actions where you can truly make a difference, rather than overextending on what’s beyond reach.
3. Check Your Six
Growth-Oriented Self-Reflection — General Philosophy: Continuously evaluate actions, learn from experiences, and adjust plans based on new insights. Build resilience through regular reflection to ensure you’re aligned with both past lessons and future goals.
Flow with Nature (Wu Wei) — Taoist: Embrace harmony with life’s natural rhythms, releasing rigid control in favor of balance and ease within effort. Regularly assess if actions feel harmonious and adapt as needed.

#keep yourself nice
clean, kind, and strong
keep yourself nice is an act of love. rigorous self-honesty and integrity lead to aligning actions and values. clear values make choices sharper, simpler, and reduce friction, building a reliable person. consistent integrity attracts collaborators who value depth and mutual gain.

reciprocity and resilience reinforce each other in relationships. respect and transparency invite others to respond in kind. cooperation often outcompetes competition, in both nature and society. build and use networked strategies to sustain long-term mutual benefit.

enduring well-being thrives through harmony and social trust. happiness emerges from self-alignment within meaningful relationships. individual and collective satisfaction grow from mutual respect. reciprocity, resilience, and purpose create a fulfilling life.

#big things first
big things begin from little ones. so start small - strategic focus, resourcefulness, and staying within one’s sphere of influence all scale upwards. prioritize well, choosing at all. practice actions that yield meaningful returns, and channel energy where outcomes align with values. focusing on high-impact tasks reduces waste.

a curated mental approach enhances the process, finding satisfaction in the work itself. productive routines with deliberate pauses and acknowledgments reinforce engagement, making effort sustainable and enjoyable. active focus and purposeful mental clarity increase resilience and help us stay present.

self-awareness of limits and the length of the race make forgiveness easy and mutually attainable. when actions align with capacity and purpose, progress compounds naturally, creating a cycle where impact, focus, and satisfaction reinforce each other.

# check your six
look behind you, look backwards.  literally, too.  look forwards, look UP.  both of those do literally, too - and neck stretches. write things down, read them later, and learn from your past.  head on a swivel and >expand your horizons< then rise above those and do it again.
